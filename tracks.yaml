            behaving in production, to get a high level picture of the
            quality/stability. Examples of SLIs are "error reply rate on a per
            month basis", or "P99 response times over a week". This gives the
            service owner a valuable input if there is reason to work on
            stability.

            This check validates both that you have tests, and that none of them
            are failing on CI.

            Success or failure of tests is determined by using the JUnit test
            results reported during Tingle builds of the default branch.

          description: >
            The check will fail if your coverage is <50%.

            Even though code coverage can be a misleading metric, since
            it doesn't actually guarantee any quality, the lack of
            coverage does prove lack of tests. Therefore, based on the
            numbers from the original track, the requirement is to
            have branch coverage higher than 50% when running your tests.

            The component should have a continuous delivery pipeline, which in
            addition to continuous integration automatically prepares and tracks
            a release to production. The desired outcome is that a new release
            can be pushed to production at any time with up to a few clicks. By
            eliminating nearly all manual tasks, developers become more
            productive.

            intended to be used to alert you when error budgets are exceeded,

            The component should have a continuous deployment pipeline, which in
            addition to continuous delivery also deploys the component with full
            automation if every step in the pipeline succeeds. This places more
            responsibility on the test suite, since there is no opportunity for
            manual inspection between the default branch and production. There
            must be a way to roll back a deployment to a previous version if the
            deployment is broken for any reason.

            Components must have an on-call rotation identifier configured in

            ping an on-call goalie from Backstage in the event of an incident.

            This check will NOT look to see what level of coverage your rotation
            provides; you may have a round-the-clock rotation, or a 10am-5pm
            local time rotation, whatever is most appropriate for your
            component.

            There have been no flaky tests detected for this website for the

            reported at during CI builds of the default branch.

            A test is flaky if you get different test results for the same
            commit. Living with flaky tests is often time consuming and
            typically lowers confidence in the test suite.

            Using an appropriate component type helps Soundcheck determine which
            checks are valid for your component. It also helps Backstage show
            the correct functionality.
